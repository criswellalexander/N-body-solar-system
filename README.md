# N-body-solar-system

Work in progress. 

Personal project for fun and practice. Places planets around sun and uses numerical integration to find orbital paths. Generalizable to other bodies besides sun/planets. 

Main engine works, but there's something off with the timesteps and how the code moves planets from point to point.
